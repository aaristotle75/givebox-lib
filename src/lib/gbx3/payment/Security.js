          <p>
            The Givebox approach to security is designed to protect both you and your customers. We monitor every transaction, we continuously innovate in fraud prevention, and we protect your data like our business depends on it—because it does. We adhere to industry-leading standards to manage our network, secure our web and client applications, and set policies across our organization.
          </p>
          <h4>Encryption and monitoring</h4>
          <p>
            Givebox enables trusted transactions between you and your customers by making secure payments as simple as possible. We do this by bringing to our sellers the technologies and monitoring that once were only available to the largest of merchants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Givebox encrypts transactions at the point of purchase and tokenizes data once it reaches our servers. We track the purchase as it goes through our software. We monitor your money until it’s deposited into your bank account.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, we monitor each transaction to detect suspicious behavior. Givebox uses our algorithms to spot and freeze malicious or suspicious activity. We’re looking out for you and your customers at each step.
          </p>
          <h4>Partners in security</h4>
          <p>
            As the merchant of record for every transaction, which means we’re dedicated to keeping your business safe. We deal with the banks on your behalf and take care of compliance, regulation and processing so you can focus on running your business. We’ll go to bat for you if someone disputes a transaction, and we’ll make sure your money moves quickly and securely into your bank account. Givebox does the heavy lifting. You just focus on your business.
          </p>
          <span className="sectionTitle2">Layered Security</span>
          <p>Card-processing systems adhere to the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).</p>
          <h4>Stopping fraud before it happens</h4>
          <p>We stop fraud via live monitoring programs that analyze transactions as they’re happening. This is known as risk visualization. The approach helps us detect and investigate suspicious activity before a fraudulent charge takes place. This method is not only a pioneering way for us to protect merchants, but it’s also a better way to build an automated system to detect criminals that will scale as our business grows.</p>
          <h4>Getting stronger as we grow</h4>
          <p>We’ve designed Givebox to grow stronger the more people transact. The better data set we have to analyze, the smarter our anti-fraud algorithms become. Think of it this way: if cars on a highway drove by only occasionally, it’d be tough to distinguish the ones speeding from the ones travelling within the limit. But on a crowded highway, it’s easy to spot the reckless driver weaving in and out of traffic. Likewise, more Givebox customers allow our proprietary systems to spot the bad guys easily.</p>
          <h4>Secure network, servers, and data</h4>
          <p>Givebox's network and servers are housed in a secure facility monitored around the clock by dedicated security staff.</p>
