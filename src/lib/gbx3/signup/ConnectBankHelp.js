               <span style={{ display: 'block', fontWeight: 500, fontSize: 16 }}>Givebox's Legal Obligation to Verify Your Identity</span>
               <span>
                 All US financial institutions such as banks, credit card issuers and transaction processors such as Givebox are required by law to verify the identity of the person 
                 behind any and all Accounts into which money is collected.
               </span>
               <span style={{ display: 'block', marginTop: 5 }}>
                 Verification mitigates money laundering and terrorist financing.  Givebox takes advantage of the fact that you had to prove to the bank you are who you say you are.  
                 Therefore, by linking and confirming your bank account, the background work has already been done and Givebox has now met the legal requirements to protect you and themselves.
               </span>

               <span style={{ display: 'block', fontWeight: 500, fontSize: 16 }}>Faster Verification with Plaid</span>
                 When you connect with Plaid, we can verify you immediately, usually within minutes as long as the name on your bank account matches you Organization's name.
